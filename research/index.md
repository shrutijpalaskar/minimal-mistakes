I am interested in enabling machines to learn from multiple modalities of data like text, audio, video, semantics as humans naturally do.

### Ongoing Research


* **Multimodal Video Understanding**  
Exploring video summarization and understanding to identify differences and similarities in two similar videos. Generalizing abstractive summarization for open-domain videos using the [How2 dataset](https://github.com/srvk/how2-dataset).


* **End-to-End and Multimodal Speech Recognition**  
Building robust direct acoustic-to-word models for audio-only and audio-visual data

  

### Summer Internships

* **[Facebook AI](https://ai.facebook.com/research/speech-and-audio)**  
Research Intern, Summer 2020  
Interning with the Speech and Audio team on multimodal ASR models. More soon!


* **[Abridge AI](https://www.abridge.com)**  
Research Intern, Summer 2019  
Worked with Abridge -- an NLP-based healthcare startup in Pittsburgh -- on understanding Doctor-Patient dialogs and conversation summaries.


* **[JSALT 2018](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/)**  
As part of the JHU summer workshop (JSALT), I worked with [Prof. Lucia Specia](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/L.Specia/) and [Prof. Raman Arora](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html) on the [Grounded Sequence to Sequence Transduction Team](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/grounded-sequence-sequence-transduction/) team working on multiview learning, summarization and speech recognition using the [How2](https://github.com/srvk/how2-dataset) data

* **[JSALT 2017](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/2017-jelinek-workshop)**   
I worked with [Prof. Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/) and [Prof. Odette Scharenborg](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?2user=hyz2eHkAAAAJ&hl=nl) as part of the [Speaking Rosetta Team](http://129.199.81.135/cmuworkshop/) working on multimodal speech recognition

### Past Projects

* **DARPA AIDA**  
Advised by [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) and [Prof. Florian Metze](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html)


* **Topic Modeling for Electronic Medical Records**  
Advised by [Prof. Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/)  
Class project for Probabilistic Graphical Models (10-708 Spring 2017)

### Undergrad Internships

During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work on computer vision problems with [Dr. Hyunsung Park](https://sites.google.com/site/hyunsung/) and [Prof. Ramesh Raskar](http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/) at the MIT Media Lab mentored [REDX Innovation Labs](http://redx.io), on machine translation with [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) and on recommender systems with [Harshad Saykhedkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshadss/?originalSubdomain=in) from a startup, [Sokrati Technologies](https://sokrati.com).
