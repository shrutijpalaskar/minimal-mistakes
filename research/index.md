I am interested in enabling machines to learn from multiple modalities of data like text, audio, video, semantics as humans naturally do. Currently, I am working on building deep learning models for multimodal speech recognition and video understanding from open-domain videos like the [How2 dataset](https://github.com/srvk/how2-dataset) and dialog summarization for doctor-patient conversations.

### Ongoing Research

* **End-to-End Speech Recognition**

* **Multimodal Video Understanding**

* **Doctor-Patient Dialog Summarization**


### Summer Internships

* **[JSALT](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/) 2018**
As part of the JHU summer workshop (JSALT), I worked with [Prof. Lucia Specia](https://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/L.Specia/) and [Prof. Raman Arora](http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~raman/Home.html) on the [Grounded Sequence to Sequence Transduction Team](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/18-workshop/grounded-sequence-sequence-transduction/) team working on multiview learning, summarization and speech recognition using the [How2](https://github.com/srvk/how2-dataset) data

* **[JSALT](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/workshops/17-workshop/) 2017** 
I participated in JSALT in 2017 as well working with [Prof. Emmanuel Dupoux](http://www.lscp.net/persons/dupoux/) and [Prof. Odette Scharenborg](https://scholar.google.nl/citations?2user=hyz2eHkAAAAJ&hl=nl) on the [Speaking Rosetta Team](http://129.199.81.135/cmuworkshop/) working on multimodal speech recognition

### Past Projects

* **DARPA AIDA**
Advised by [Prof. Eduard Hovy](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hovy/) and [Prof. Florian Metze](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~fmetze/interACT/Home.html)


* **Topic Modeling for Electronic Medical Records**
Advised by [Prof. Eric Xing](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~epxing/)

### Undergrad Internships

During my undergrad, I was fortunate to work on computer vision problems with [Dr. Hyunsung Park](https://sites.google.com/site/hyunsung/) and [Prof. Ramesh Raskar](http://web.media.mit.edu/~raskar/) at the MIT Media Lab mentored [REDX Innovation Labs](http://redx.io), on machine translation with [Prof. Ganesh Ramakrishnan](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~ganesh/) at [IIT Bombay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in) and on recommender systems with [Harshad Saykhedkar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/harshadss/?originalSubdomain=in) from a startup, [Sokrati Technologies](https://sokrati.com).
